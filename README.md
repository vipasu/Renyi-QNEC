# Renyi Quantum Null Energy Condition

In this repo we are studying appropriate measures of renyi divergences in order to probe whether critical systems obey a conjectured information-theoretic inequality.

## Features
- Different hamiltonians (TFIM, XXZ, WZW(2)2)
- Iteratively calculated excited ground states
- Entanglement entropies of chains, relative entropies and sandwiched renyi divergences

## TODOs
- Check the support condition of relative entropies
